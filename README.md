# Auto.LLM
Allow an LLM to completely access a computer, by itself.

Note:
We recommend you run this in Docker, on a virtual machine, on a closed/private network, and ensure that you watch what the LLM is doing closely for security.

This was originally designed to be an experiment to see what would LLMs do if they owned an entire computer.
